/*
=== HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM ===

1. Run this program
2. Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the 'test_folder' directory
3. Try these actions to see events:
   - Create a new text file
   - Edit the sample.txt file and save it
   - Rename a file
   - Delete a file
   - Create a new folder

=== UNDERSTANDING THE OUTPUT ===

When you see events, here's what they mean:

Event Type 1 (RENAME): 
- Triggered when files are created, deleted, or renamed
- This includes drag-and-drop operations

Event Type 2 (CHANGE):
- Triggered when file contents are modified
- This happens when you save changes to an existing file

Event Type 3 (RENAME + CHANGE):
- Sometimes both events happen together
- Common during certain file operations

=== LEARNING POINTS ===

1. **Asynchronous Nature**: Notice how the program doesn't freeze while waiting
   for file changes. It responds immediately to events while staying responsive.

2. **Event-Driven Programming**: Your code only runs when something interesting
   happens (a file changes), rather than constantly checking.

3. **Callback Functions**: The onFileChange() function is a "callback" - 
   the system calls it back when events occur.

4. **Resource Management**: Always clean up system resources (handles, oWatchers)
   when you're done with them.

=== COMMON FILE OPERATIONS AND THEIR EVENTS ===

- Creating a file: RENAME event
- Editing and saving a file: CHANGE event  
- Deleting a file: RENAME event
- Moving a file: RENAME event
- Copying a file: RENAME event (for the new copy)
