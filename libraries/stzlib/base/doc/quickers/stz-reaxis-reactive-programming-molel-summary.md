### Overview of Reaxis: A Natural Model for Reactive Programming in Ring by Softanza

Reaxis is a reactive programming system within the Softanza library for the Ring language, designed to address the semantic chaos in traditional reactive frameworks (e.g., RxJS, Akka Streams). It replaces confusing metaphors—like "backpressure" (hydraulics), "callbacks" (telephones), and "observables/subscribers" (publishing)—with natural, descriptive language that reflects actual data flow, reducing cognitive load and making reactive programming intuitive.

#### Core Problems Addressed
Traditional reactive programming burdens developers with fragmented concepts:
- Metaphors from unrelated domains (plumbing, events, publishing) obscure simplicity.
- Terms like "callbacks," "handlers," "producers/consumers," and "hot/cold streams" create mental overhead.
- Complex error propagation, backpressure management, and subscription coordination lead to architectural chaos.

Reaxis re-engineers semantics from first principles, focusing on what happens rather than analogies.

#### Key Innovations in Semantics and Terminology
- **Rfunctions**: Replace "callbacks/handlers" with "functions that wait" in a declarative state, activated only by data flow. They support localized error handling via `OnSuccess()` and `OnError()`.
- **Stream-Centric Flow**: Eliminates producer/consumer roles; data enters via `Receive()`, transforms via `return`, and flows naturally without external coordination.
- **Overflow Strategy**: Replaces "backpressure" with intuitive "overflow" for handling excess data (e.g., `BUFFER_EXPAND`, `BUFFER_REJECT_NEWEST`).
- **Natural Timing**: Uses clear verbs like `RunEvery()` (repeating intervals) and `RunAfter()` (delays), avoiding ambiguous `SetInterval/SetTimeout`. Control via `StopTimer()` or `StopAllTimers()`.

#### Conceptual Architecture
Reaxis follows a clear three-tier hierarchy built on LibUV for asynchronous I/O:
1. **Container (ReactiveSystem)**: Provides shared infrastructure (timers, HTTP clients, schedulers). Manages multiple streams and activates the system via `RunLoop()`.
2. **Stream**: Independent data pipelines with four stages:
   - **Receive**: Data intake (e.g., `ReceiveMany([items])`).
   - **Buffer**: Absorbs traffic spikes with configurable size and overflow strategies; monitored via `OnBufferOverflow()`.
   - **Queue**: Small FIFO structure (5-10 items) for ordered processing.
   - **Rfunctions Pipeline**: Sequential processing (e.g., `Transform()`, `Filter()`, `OnPassed()`, `OnNoMore()`, `OnError()`).
3. **Rfunction Level**: Individual functions await activation, process items, and handle local errors.

This model visualizes data flow as a left-to-right pipeline, making boundaries and paths explicit.

#### Declare-Then-Execute Pattern
Reaxis separates description from activation:
- Declare behavior (e.g., configure streams, Rfunctions, buffers).
- Execute via `RunLoop()` or timed feeds (e.g., `RunEvery()` for periodic data ingestion).

#### Advanced Features
- **Stream Optimization**: Hints like `OPTIMISED_FOR_NETWORK_SOURCE` enable performance tuning without altering processing code.
- **Cross-Stream Communication**: Explicit `Feed()/FeedMany()` for independent streams, avoiding tight coupling (e.g., validation stream feeds business logic stream).
- **Localized Error Management**: Errors handled per-Rfunction or per-stream, preventing propagation chains.
- **Practical Patterns**: Supports sensor monitoring, real-time trading, email queuing with anomaly detection, alerts, and orchestration across streams.

#### Benefits and Mental Model
- **Cognitive Load Reduction**: Single coherent framework (Container → Stream → Rfunction) eliminates metaphor juggling.
- **Transparency**: Visual model aids debugging; data journeys are traceable.
- **Performance**: Universal code with optional optimizations; explicit controls like `ProcessNextFromBuffer()`.
- **Comparison to Others**: Gentler learning curve than RxJS or Reactor; focuses on natural flow over complex operators.

#### Conclusion
Reaxis proves reactive programming can be simple and visual, prioritizing business logic over abstractions. It's ideal for Ring developers seeking maintainable, high-performance reactive systems, leveraging Ring's flexibility for semantic innovation. The full system is in Softanza, built on RingLibUV.
